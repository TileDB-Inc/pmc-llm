This enables TileDB Cloud to handle requests automatically and securely.\n","\n","```python\n","def pipeline_step(access_credentials: str, repo_url: str, out_directory: str, bucket_path: str, index_uri: str, in_file: str = \"rag-article-list.txt\", \n","                  num_jobs: int = 4, bucket_region: str = \"us-west-2\", hash_check: bool = True, model_name: str = \"pritamdeka/BioBERT-mnli-snli-scinli-scitail-mednli-stsb\",\n","                  index_type: str = \"IFV_FLAT\", dimensions: int = 768, ingestion_mode: str =\"BATCH\"):\n","\n","```\n","\n","#### Scalable Vector Search and Indexing\n","\n","TileDB’s vector search capabilities allow for efficient search and indexing across datasets. The pipeline supports several index types, such as **IVF_FLAT**, **VAMANA**, and **IVF_PQ**, providing flexibility to optimize for either speed or memory efficiency.\n","\n","The ability to toggle between **batch (BATCH)** and **real-time (REALTIME)** ingestion modes offers flexibility to handle different scenarios. For batch processing, you can maximize throughput, while real-time ingestion enables rapid updates to the index.\n","\n","#### Unified Ingestion for Multi-Modal Data\n","\n","The pipeline supports **multi-modal data ingestion**, meaning it can handle PDFs, text files, and abstracts using the same loader. This eliminates the need for specialized logic for different data types. The unified loader handles different formats like PDFs and text seamlessly.\n","\n","In cases where documents are stored in compressed tarballs, the pipeline is capable of **recursive extraction** of PDFs, making it ideal for complex medical or academic data ingestion scenarios.\n","\n","#### Seamless Integration with TileDB Cloud DAG\n","\n","TileDB’s **Cloud DAG** allows you to manage complex workflows with distributed jobs like consolidating chunks and data cleanup. The DAG framework ensures tasks are executed in the correct order while supporting parallel processing and efficient scaling.\n","\n","This feature simplifies managing dependencies between tasks, such as ensuring that data cleanup only occurs after ingestion has been completed.\n","\n","#### Efficient Use of TileDB's Virtual File System (VFS)\n","\n","The pipeline leverages **TileDB's Virtual File System (VFS)** to interact directly with object stores like S3, without the need for local storage. This results in faster data transfers and reduces the storage footprint during the ingestion process.\n","\n","Additionally, the VFS allows tracking of file history and logs in S3, enabling easier debugging, auditing, and progress monitoring without needing to rely on local files.\n","\n","#### Support for Embedding Models and Metadata Storage\n","\n","The pipeline integrates seamlessly with embedding models like **BioBERT** or **HuggingFace**, allowing for the storage of embeddings alongside original documents. This is crucial for **retrieval-augmented generation (RAG)** systems or any pipeline that requires similarity-based search.\n","\n","The ability to store model metadata alongside the embeddings ensures **traceability**, allowing for reproducibility when running searches or processing documents in future versions of the pipeline.\n","\n","##### Why Experimenting with an Embedding Model is Important\n","\n","Experimenting with medical-specific embedding models like BioBERT is vital because it ensures the embeddings capture domain-specific context, terminology, and nuances. This precision enhances the quality of responses from LLMs when generating or retrieving information from scientific papers. By tying embeddings to the LLM's response, the system delivers more accurate, contextually relevant answers, crucial for applications in medical research or clinical insights where even slight misinterpretations can lead to incorrect conclusions.  Another way to think about this is in the context of \"human in the loop\" scenarios where humans label complex datasets. Just as medical embedding models require domain-specific training to understand intricate concepts, human labelers also need specialized knowledge to correctly annotate data. For example, labeling medical datasets is far more complex than identifying basic objects like \"this is a bird.\" If a non-expert incorrectly labels a medical condition, it could misinform the model, leading to inaccurate predictions or insights. Embedding models, like humans in these tasks, need to be properly trained with the right context to ensure meaningful and accurate representations.\n","\n","#### Real-Time Feedback with Logging and File History\n","\n","A key strength of the pipeline is its ability to provide **real-time feedback** on the progress of document ingestion. By logging successfully ingested files and noting failed attempts (through `file_history` and `missed_paper_history`), the pipeline allows you to quickly diagnose and address issues.\n","\n","This feedback loop ensures that failed files can be reprocessed without having to re-run the entire ingestion pipeline. Logs are stored directly in the object store for easy retrieval and auditing.\n","\n","#### Flexible Configuration and Extensibility\n","\n","The pipeline is highly configurable, with parameters such as:\n","\n","- **Number of jobs**: To control workload distribution.\n","- **Bucket path**: To specify object store locations.\n","- **Index type**: To optimize for different search strategies (e.g., IVF_FLAT for faster searches or VAMANA for memory efficiency).\n","- **Embedding dimensions**: To configure the model’s vector size (e.g., 768 for BioBERT).\n","\n","This flexibility allows the pipeline to scale based on dataset size and processing needs. Furthermore, the ability to switch between **batch** and **real-time** modes allows for dynamic processing depending on the workload.\n","\n","#### Summary\n","\n","This ingestion pipeline leverages **distributed abstraction**, **secure credential handling**, and **scalable vector search capabilities**, while remaining flexible for multi-modal data ingestion. The built-in features such as **change detection**, **retry logic**, and **embedding model integration** make this pipeline robust and scalable, handling even the most complex medical document ingestion and processing tasks.\n"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","id":"02596261-ce73-4715-b50c-1b91dc08882b","metadata":{},"source":["## Idexing and Ingestion Exploration and Guidelines \n","### Driver and Embedding Generation\n","For a deeper exploration, during the indexing/ingestion of the PDFs and text we see two DAGs being created.

Ideally, each task should process one file or partition at a time to reduce memory footprint and avoid resource contention.\n","\n","* **Memory Footprint:** Assign memory just sufficient for loading and processing a single file. This prevents over-allocation of resources while ensuring that each pod can handle its workload efficiently. Adjust memory requests/limits based on file size and processing complexity.\n","\n","* **Parallelism:** Use smaller pods with fewer tasks to maximize parallelism. More, smaller pods allow Kubernetes to distribute tasks across multiple CPU cores or nodes, improving throughput.\n","\n","* **Resource Allocation:** Ensure that each pod’s resource requests (CPU, memory) are tuned to its task size.
